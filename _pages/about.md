My name is Alex Della Schiava, I am a PhD student at the Graduate School of Mathematics, Nagoya University. I am lucky enough to be part of the [Quantum Algorithms and Complexity research group](https://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~legall/index.html) under the precious supervision of [prof. Fran√ßois Le Gall](https://www.francoislegall.com/).

Before that I completed a master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Udine, Italy (2023); a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence & Cybersecurity at the University of Klagenfurt, Austria (2023); a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Udine, Italy (2020).
