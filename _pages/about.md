Hello! My name is Alex Della Schiava, I am a PhD student at the Graduate School of Mathematics, Nagoya University. I am lucky enough to be a part of the Quantum Algorithms and Complexity research group where I entertain my research endeavours under the precious supervision of prof. Fran√ßois Le Gall.
